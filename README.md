# Use predictive modeling to determine the localization of proteins within different cell types

## Machine Learning for Life Science Project 2

## 0 Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine the localization of proteins within different cell types. 

To develop a predictive model, pre-trained efficientNet and various strategies are used.

All hyperparameters are optimized through trial and error, then best set is chosen.
